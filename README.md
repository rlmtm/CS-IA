# CS-IA (Fluent Flow)

This website was created to help an expat living in a foreign country improve his conversational skills and better integrate with his colleagues, many of whom do not speak fluent English. The client preferred an interactive and practical approach to language learning, emphasizing speaking and sentence construction over rote memorization.  

## Features  
- **Interactive Conversations**: The program simulates realistic conversations in foreign language by asking and answering questions to help users practice sentence construction and grammar.  
- **Hands-Free Experience**: Designed for ease of use, the interface is simple and ergonomic, allowing users to focus on speaking without unnecessary distractions.  
- **Conversation Transcript**: Users receive a transcript of their interactions, highlighting errors and grammatical mistakes for review and improvement.  
- **User Progress Tracking**: A secure login system enables users to store conversation transcripts and track their progress over time.  

## Technical Overview  
The website is built using Python and the Flask framework for the following reasons:  
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Python ensures the program runs seamlessly on any operating system.  
- **API Integration**: The program leverages tools like the ChatGPT API for dynamic conversation generation and text-to-speech conversion.  
- **Database Support**: Local databases store user transcripts and session information, ensuring a smooth and personalized experience.  
- **Scalability**: Flask provides the flexibility to expand the website’s features as needed.  

This project combines conversational AI and a user-friendly interface to create a practical language-learning tool tailored to the client's needs.
